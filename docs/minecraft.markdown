# Heilige Maagden Minecraft Server
<a class="minecraft-link">minecraft.heiligemaagden.com</a>
<div class="gap"></div>
Our server is back! New start, new world, same concept. We play in hard-difficulty survival, with PvP enabled but (usually) not the essence of the server. Everyone is free to join on **minecraft.heiligemaagden.com**. The server is vanilla-ish - though we run some mods to optimise game handling barely anything in-game gets changed. We also use four datapacks to alter the game behavior slightly:
1. One adds gravestones to the game: when a player die, a gravestone will spawn with their items where they died, which can be collected. This way, when you die, you don't have to rush to get your stuff within the despawn time.
2. A second one makes it so item frames that are currently holding items will turn invisible. This allows you to use item frames for decorational purposes without heaving the ugly leather background appear.
3. We have one that makes nametags craftable. To make one, you'll need two leather or rabbit hide and one string.
4. Lastly, we have one that pauses the game when no one is online, that way the total age of the server will beter represent overall playtime by our players.

### Daily Blackout Period
Every day, our server will go offline between 6 am and 7:30 am. If you're still actively playing, you will be warned and should probably disconnect. If you're AFK you'll be kicked. The server will begin to start up at 7:30 am, though it can take some time for it to get back online. You should really only be connecting starting around 7:40 am if possible.

### Useful Resources
In Discord, we've created a "server-coords" channel where you can share and/or save important coordinates from our server. Also, if you want to know weather the server is up, you can check the status page on <a href="https://admin.minecraft.heiligemaagden.com/status">https://admin.minecraft.heiligemaagden.com/status</a>. It may warn you of being unsafe; it's not, though I won't oblige you to continue. If that page is down as well, not only our server but also it's host have been turned off or disconnected, meanning the server will be offline for sure.

### World Map
This is a top-down view of the overworld. This map will be updated once every day around 7 am. You can also open a fullscreen version of this map [here](/minecraft-map/unmined.index.html).
